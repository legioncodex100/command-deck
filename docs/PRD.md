PRD: Command Deck

1. Vision

Command Deck is a specialized dashboard designed for the "Architect-Pilot" to manage the end-to-end lifecycle of building applications using AI. It serves as a translation layer between high-level business vision and technical execution.

2. Target User

The Architect-Pilot: A visionary who understands systems and logic flows but relies on AI agents (like those in Google Antigravity) to handle the code implementation.

3. Core Features

Drafting Table (Logic-to-Blueprint): Converts plain English requirements into a detailed technical blueprint (JSON).

Structural Auditor: Analyzes implementation code for "Technical Debt," "Tangled Pipes" (Logic mixed with UI), and modularity violations.

Project Memory: A persistent record of the "as-built" state, ensuring agents maintain context across multiple sessions.

Antigravity Command Sync: Generates multi-agent instructions specifically formatted for the Antigravity IDE.

4. Technical Integration

LLM Engine: Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Voice Interface: Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS.

Design System: Google Stitch (Material Design 3).

IDE Target: Google Antigravity.

5. Success Metrics

100% adherence to Strict Layer Separation (SLS).

Elimination of "Context Drift" during multi-day AI builds.
