1. Vision

Command Deck is an open-workbench lifecycle orchestrator for Architect-Pilots. It digitizes the professional agency workflow through an immutable chain of contextual Markdown artifacts, overseen by a council of World-Class AI Consultants.

2. The 11 Pillars: Chronological Alphabetic Sequence

The mission follows a strict linear sequence where each lettered pillar hardens the blueprint for the next:

Pillar A: Discovery Lab (Business Intent -> PRD.md)

Pillar B: Strategy Room (Technical Directive -> STRATEGY.md)

Pillar C: Substructure Architect (Data Foundation -> SCHEMA.sql)

Pillar D: Design Studio (Visual DNA & UI -> DESIGN.md, STITCH_PROMPT.md)

Pillar E: Planning Hub (Execution Roadmap -> BACKLOG.md)

Pillar F: Construction Factory (Pilot Scripts -> INSTRUCTIONS.md)

Pillar G: Integration Bridge (Zero-Paste Sync / GitHub / local Disk)

Pillar H: Structural Auditor (SLS Compliance & Integrity Audit)

Pillar I: Context Bridge (Memory Synthesis -> MEMORY.md)

Pillar J: Documentation Engine (Technical Writer -> TECH_SPEC.md)

Pillar K: Mission Mural (Project Historian -> CHRONOLOGY.md)

3. Operational Protocols: Cumulative Inheritance

To eliminate "Information Decay," every pillar inherits the complete history of all preceding artifacts:

Strategy (B) inherits [A].

Substructure (C) inherits [A + B].

Design (D) inherits [A + B + C].

Planning (E) inherits [A + B + C + D].

Construction (F) inherits [A + B + C + D + E].

4. Antigravity Indexing Rules

The /docs Mandate: All generated artifacts MUST be saved to the /docs directory.

Context Injection: Agents MUST "Index /docs" before generation.

SLS Compliance: Strict Layer Separation (Data/Logic/UI) is enforced.

5. Technical Guardrails

Limits: 150 lines per file (Strict).
