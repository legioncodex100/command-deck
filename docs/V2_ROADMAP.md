Command Deck v2: The Comprehensive Companion Roadmap

To move from an MVP to a full Architect-Pilot companion, the Command Deck must evolve from a "Single-Task Studio" into a "Lifecycle Orchestrator."

1. The Seven Pillars of the Companion App

Pillar A: The Discovery Lab (Idea → Manifesto)

The Feature: A guided interview interface where Gemini asks strategic questions.

The Output: An automatically generated PRD.md.

Pillar B: The Schema Architect (Substructure Design)

The Feature: Visual "Node-Link" diagram for database relationships.

The Output: Validated SQL migrations and updated docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.

Pillar C: The Work Order Factory (The Pilot Script)

The Feature: A "Phase Selector" (Foundation, Framing, etc.).

The Output: A perfectly formatted INSTRUCTIONS.md for Antigravity Agents.

Pillar D: The Real-Time Structural Auditor (Continuous Inspection)

The Feature: Integration with Project Memory to check for logic drift.

The Output: Integrity scores and AI-suggested refactoring plans.

Pillar E: The Context Bridge (Long-Term Memory)

The Feature: A "Session Summary" tool that compresses chat logs into a MEMORY.md.

Pillar F: The Documentation Engine (Developer & User Knowledge)

The Feature: Automatically generates technical documentation for future developers and a "Help Center" for end-users based on the app's features.

The Output: DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md and USER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md.

Pillar G: The Integration Bridge (The Git/IDE Sync)

The Feature: Direct API connection to GitHub/GitLab and Google Antigravity.

The Output: One-click deployment of the /docs folder directly to the repository.
