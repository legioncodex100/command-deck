Module Spec: The Documentation Engine

Objective: Automatically generate technical and user knowledge bases from project blueprints and PRDs.

1. Developer Documentation (Tech Spec)

Gemini generates a DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md containing:

System Overview: Explanation of the high-level architecture and the "Four Layers" strategy.

Data Dictionary: Automatically generated table explaining Supabase schemas and RLS policies.

Logic Maps: Integration of Mermaid.js syntax to visualize the logic_flow from the blueprint.

2. User Knowledge Base (Help Center)

Gemini generates a USER_HELP_CENTER.md containing:

Feature Guides: Benefit-driven "How-to" steps extracted from the PRD user stories.

FAQ: Troubleshooting guides generated by identifying common edge cases in the logic flow.
