description: Update the MEMORY.md system log
---

1. Read `docs/MEMORY.md` to understand the current state.
2. Determine the changes made to the system (new features, refactors, bug fixes).
3. Update Section 2 "Active Platform Context" if any Pillar status has changed (e.g., from "IN PROGRESS" to "Functional").
4. Append a new entry to Section 3 "Maintenance Log" with the following format:
   ```markdown
   **[YYYY-MM-DD] [Title of Update] (vX.X)**
   *   **Action**: [Description of what was done]
   *   **Action**: [Another action]
   *   **Next Steps**: [What needs to happen next]
   ```
5. Ensure the file limits are respected/cleaned if too long (optional).
